Deployment, operations, and cleaning are the three operating modes of the project solution.  An openrc file with the necessary login credentials to access a particular cloud is used to access the cloud.  When the solution is deployed, it should attach a TAG to every item it generates in the OpenStack Cloud so that items may be easily identified.  Make sure the execute rights are granted before executing the install, operate, and cleaning files.  The following instructions are used to execute the code:

1)./install openrc tag ssh_key
2)./operate openrc tag ssh_Key
3)./cleanup openrc tag ssh_Key

A file that contains your own rc file with the necessary credentials is called an openrc file.  The file containing a public key is referenced by the ssh_key option.  Secure authentication and communication with distant systems are made possible by this key file.  Verify that the public key of your Ubuntu PC is contained in the designated ssh_key file.
